     <h3> A Little Piece of History</h3>
     <p>  Our passion started in the early 2000's when a group of friends           started writing reviews for each other about their favourite games at the time. Our reviews soon became popular in school and we started writing reveiws for the school paper to the whole school and we was able to reach out to more and more people.<br>
     Eventually we left school but our fun didn't end there, we soon founded our own webiste in 2009 and our reviews grew on a larger scale. Our fame grew    and suddenly game publishers and developers started contacting us to       review their game, small companies at first but it didn't take long the the main stream developers to take notice. <br>
     In 2011 our big moment arrived as the game developer giant Bethesda Softworks contacted us and requested we review their newest title "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim". We was shocked by this and jumped at the opportunity. Ever since then we have been reviewing AAA games with the approval of the big gaming developers and our clientbase and our business grow.</p>
